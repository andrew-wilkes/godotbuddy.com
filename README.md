# Godot Buddy Website and Apps

![Godot Buddy](themes/godot-buddy-theme/static/img/godot-buddy.png)


The **website** uses the [HUGO](https://gohugo.io) static website generator.

The **Apps** are developed in the [Godot](https://godotengine.org) game engine.

## Tools

**Godot Buddy** will provide various useful tools for **Godot** game developers.

### Class Explorer

The **Class Explorer** is an advanced way to explore the available classes in the Godot API and to target the classes that interest you the most, and to attach your meta-data to them.

![Class List](resources/class-explorer.png)

At the top is a search box to filter the listed class names.

Your most-clicked classes are listed at the top and highlighted, and the rest listed below in alphabetical order. Also, the basic description of the class is displayed if you hover over a button.

Clicking on one of the buttons will open a page showing information about the class together with your custom meta-data and other relevant info.

This is a work in progress ...
